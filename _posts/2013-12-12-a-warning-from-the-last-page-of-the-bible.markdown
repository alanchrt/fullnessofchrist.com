In Rev. 22:18, 19, we read,

> "I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book."

The plagues which are written in this book of Revelation are the wrath of God.

God will not permit anyone to trifle with His sacred Word. A severe warning is given to those who add to or subtract from this book - and this principle applies to all of Scripture, since this warning is found on the last page of the Bible.

The first blunder that Eve committed in Genesis 3 was to add and take away from God's word. God had said to Adam in Genesis 2:17, "From the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, because, the day you will eat from it, you will surely die." Adam had undoubtedly communicated this accurately to Eve. But when Eve was asked by the serpent in Gen.3:1, "What has God said?", Eve added and subtracted from God's command in her reply. First of all she added something. She said, "God has said, `You shall not eat from it **nor touch it**' " (Gen.3:3). God had never said anything about **touching** the tree. And then Eve subtracted. She said, "...**lest you die**" (Gen 3:3), weakening the stern warning of God Who had said, "You shall **surely die**." The phrase "lest you die" implies that there is a possibility that you may not die. So we see in the beginning of the Bible that sin began through adding to and subtracting from God's Word. And so, right at the end of the Bible, there is a strong warning against adding to or subtracting from God's Word.

Today, many have added their human traditions to the Word of God and made them almost equally important. Likewise, many have subtracted from God's Word by saying that obedience to certain small commandments is unimportant.

We must be very careful to eliminate from our lives and our homes everything that is contrary to God's Word. And we must be equally careful to add to our lives and our homes everything that we have missed out from God's Word.

Through our attitude to His Word, God tests us to see whether we are ready to live with Him for eternity or not.

Ps.138:2 states that God has magnified His Word above His Name. So if we dishonour God's word, we dishonour God's Name. Many denominations in "Christianity" have added to and subtracted from God's Word. Thus they have ended in spiritual harlotry. We need to be warned by their failure.
