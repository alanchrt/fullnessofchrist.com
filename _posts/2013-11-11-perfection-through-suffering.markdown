> "After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you" (1 Pet. 5:10).

Here God is called the God of ALL GRACE. He leads His people through suffering in order that He might impart His grace to them and "perfect and establish them". Paul experienced God's all-sufficient grace through receiving a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor.12:7-10).  Peter's first letter too has much to say about suffering as the means by which God dispenses His grace to us.

We read that "Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS, WHO COMMITTED NO SIN ......... Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh HAS CEASED FROM SIN" (1 Pet.2:21, 22; 4:1).  Here we are clearly told to follow the example of Christ Who suffered, so that we might not sin at any time. Grace is meant to make us holy "as He Who called us is Holy" (1 Pet.1:16).

Peter reminds us that "if we suffer in the flesh, we shall cease from sin and live the rest of our life, doing the will of God" (1 Pet.4:1, 2).  To "suffer in the flesh" does not mean becoming sick in the body, for no-one has ever stopped sinning thereby. It does not mean being beaten and bruised for Christ's sake either, for no-one has stopped sinning that way either. It refers rather to denying the desires of Self, which are in opposition to the will of God. Sin brings a certain pleasure. To suffer is the opposite of enjoying that pleasure. If we are willing to suffer in each and every situation, then we can cease from sin. God will help us if we are willing. In fact, He even works to make us willing (Phil.2:12, 13). But so often we resist His workings. That is why we remain defeated.

Christ suffered in the flesh, and we are to arm ourselves with the same mind. Jesus walked this way of self-denial all His life. He came to earth in the flesh and never did His own will but always the will of His Father, no matter how much suffering that may have involved (Jn.6:38). Thus He never sinned. Now, we also have the opportunity to "follow in His steps, Who committed no sin" (1 Pet. 2:21, 22).

This is the gospel (good news) of the grace of God.
