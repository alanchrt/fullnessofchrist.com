Jesus taught that God's greatest commandment is to love him with all of our hearts, all of our souls, and all of our minds (Matt. 22:37). The Bible says that, "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." (1 Cor. 2:9)

God has prepared for each of us to live our lives loving him and serving him faithfully, and ultimately that we would become exactly like Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:29). However, sin and self-will have destroyed our connection with God and caused us to live in a way contrary to what God ever intended. This sinful way we have chosen destroys our lives and makes us deserving of hell.

> "The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it." (Matt. 7:13-14)

By repentance and faith in Christ, the promise of living like Jesus can actually become a reality for us. Jesus was crucified to pay the punishment we deserve for our sins, and he rose again to conquer sin and death once and for all. If we will turn away from our old self-willed lifestyle and turn to Jesus Christ, God will come to us and live inside of us through his Holy Spirit. He will give us power to have eternal life with God and to live as Jesus lived here on earth.

> "Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing." (John 15:5)

There is no greater treasure than having God himself dwelling inside of our hearts. "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field." (Matt. 13:44)

Jesus Christ came to bring the good news that you and I can be free from the sins that have us bound, and instead, we can live eternally with his presence! Will you give everything in your life to have the treasure of Jesus Christ within you?
